# randomize music playlist
The point of this script is to do away with a music player. It will shuffle your playlist, playing your music files in a randomly decided order. It only plays music, and does nothing else. Stop the script the usual way, by pressing `Ctrl C`.

You need VLC Media Player to use this script. Notice that the tracks are played using the `cvlc` command. If your music file has audio and video, the VLC window will pop up! Therefore, make sure your tracks have only audio. (That wway, no window will pop up, and VLC will play audio as if in the background.) I suggest using AAC music files.
