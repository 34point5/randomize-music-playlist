# randomize music playlist
The point of this script is to do away with a music player. It will shuffle your playlist, playing your music files in a randomly decided order. It only plays music, and does nothing else. Stop the script the usual way, by pressing `Ctrl C`.

You need VLC Media Player to use this script. Notice that the tracks are played using the `cvlc` command. If your music file has audio and video, the VLC window will pop up! Therefore, make sure your tracks have only audio. I suggest AAC music files.
